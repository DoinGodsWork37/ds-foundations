## Terminal

Start using the terminal regularly. Start with navigating folders, creating and opening files, then move onto more advanced tasks, like using the VIM editor and cronjobs. Your proficiency with terminal and command line shortcuts will help speed up everything.

## Typing Speed

You probably can type over 60 words per minute in a Word Processor, but how fast can you type Python code?

## Keyboard Shortcuts and Commands

As with the command line and typing, you should learn the important shorcuts for the applications you use. Many applications made for computer programmers are meant to be used without a mouse, due to the early computing interfaces. Even more mainstream applications like Microsoft Excel can be utilized extensively with just the keyboard.

## Google and Stack Overflow

Whenever you run into an issue and you are stuck, you should first search the specific problem you have on Google. Often times, you will find the answer in the official documentation or on a website called [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). This website is a community forum where people can ask programming questions and other people share possible solutions and answers. It is a great resource and even the most experienced developers ask questions here when they are voyaging into new territory.

## Documentation and Mathematics

You should start getting into the habit of reading programming documentation as well as papers about statistical and probabilistic models.

During the bootcamp, you will spend countless hours pouring through the scikit-learn documentation. Occasionally the site goes down and a small part of the internet freaks out. [Keep the PDF handy](resources/scikit-learn-docs.pdf).

## Markdown

Markdown is a simple way to add formatting — like headers, bold/italic text, and lists — to plain text. Rather than relying on HTML or WYSIWYG editors, Markdown allows you to create full pages of formatted text without ever having to remove your fingers from the keyboard, and all in a way that’s much more intuitive than HTML.

This entire Foundations program and most GitHub readme files are created in Markdown. You can easily create a personal blog or portfolio page with Markdown that links to your GitHub profile.

For a run-down of the formatting, check the [reference guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by GitHub.
