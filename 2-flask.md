### <a name="section-a"></a>1. HTML / CSS

You might be wondering why were are learning about building websites and apps? The reason is that you may want to create an interactive app or present your final projects so you can share with anyone that is not a data scientist. A beginner level understanding will enable you to do this.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. Flask

Before going anywhere, watch this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc). Read [this page](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm) as well. Although we use the internet every day, we often overlook the inner workings of it.

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. A microframework is a term used to refer to minimalistic web application frameworks. It is contrasted with full-stack framework also called enterprise frameworks.

Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn, and the community web page for Flask itself.
