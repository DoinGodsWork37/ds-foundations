## Flask

Before going anywhere, watch this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc). Read [this page](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm) as well. Although we use the internet every day, we often overlook the inner workings of it.

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. A microframework is a term used to refer to minimalistic web application frameworks. It is contrasted with full-stack framework also called enterprise frameworks.

Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn, and the community web page for Flask itself.

Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.
