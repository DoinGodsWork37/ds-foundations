### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Full Review

Several data mining and machine learning algorithms rely heavily on Linear Algebra concepts. We want all students to be comfortable with this subject. *If you have a preferred resource or textbook, feel free to use that.*

We found the coverage of Linear Algebra at Khan Academy to be sufficient enough for our curriculum. [You can find it here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra). Sal does a good job explaining the "how".

If you want to learn the "why", go through [Professor Gilbert Strang's course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) on Linear Algebra. Note this will take over 30 hours and is not required.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. Refresher

If you prefer an abridged text summary of the same topics, here is [a set of notes](resources/linear_algebra_notes.pdf) by Zico Kolter from Carnegie Mellon. The last section is on "Matrix Calculus", which is not usually covered in college classes. It is useful to review in preparation for the bootcamp.

### <a name="section-c"></a>3. Summary

If you have taken Linear Algebra in an academic setting before, here is a [4 page summary version](resources/linear_algebra_4.pdf) or watch this [25 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZumgfOei0Ak).
