### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Full Review

Several data mining and machine learning algorithms rely heavily on Linear Algebra concepts. We want all students to comfortable with this subject.

We found the coverage of Linear Algebra at Khan Academy to be sufficient enough for our curriculum. [You can find it here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra). Sal does a good job explaining the "how".

As an alternative to Khan Academy, you can go through [Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Applications](http://codingthematrix.com/). It is an archived class that was taught at Brown University. The professor teaches Linear Algebra through Python. There are no video lectures, but there are [copies of the lecture slides](http://codingthematrix.com/#slides) and [code solutions](http://resources.codingthematrix.com/) as well. We like this course because it is similar to the Think X series by Allen Downey that we strong utilize in our sections.

If you want to learn the "why", go through [Professor Gilbert Strang's course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8) on Linear Algebra. Note this will take over 40 hours and is not required to understand the majority of machine learning algorithms.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. Refresher

If you prefer an abridged text summary of the same topics, here is [a set of notes](resources/linear_algebra_notes.pdf) by Zico Kolter from Carnegie Mellon.

### <a name="section-c"></a>3. Summary

If you have taken Linear Algebra in an academic setting before, here is a [4 page summary version](resources/linear_algebra_4.pdf) that should suffice.
