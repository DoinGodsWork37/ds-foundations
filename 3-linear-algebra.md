## Linear Algebra

Several data mining and machine learning algorithms rely heavily on Linear Algebra concepts. We want all students to comfortable with this subject.

For an in-depth coverage of Linear Algebra, Khan Academy has a well designed course. [You can find it here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra).

If you prefer a text summary of the same topics, here is [a set of notes](resources/linear_algebra_notes.pdf) by Zico Kolter from Carnegie Mellon.

If you have taken Linear Algebra in an academic setting before, here is a [4 page summary version](resources/linear_algebra_4.pdf) that should suffice.
