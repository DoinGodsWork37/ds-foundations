### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Study Options

If you have not reviewed Calculus in awhile, review the [Khan Academy section](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home). Review functions, limits, basic derivatives and integrals. [Paul's Online Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) is a text-based alternative.

#### Review Option
###### (1 - 2 hours)

1. If you want an abridged text summary, here is [a set of notes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/mvc.pdf) by Barbara Niethammer and Andrew Dancer at Oxford University. There are not many visualizations and the last section dives into manifolds. Manifolds are out of the scope of our curriculum, but take a stab at learning more about it. Top-notch data scientists are able to alter off-the-shelf algorithms with advanced mathematics and create truly amazing machine learning systems.

2. If you have taken Multivariable Calculus in an academic setting before, here is a [1 page summary version](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/calculus-1.pdf).

#### Comprehensive Option
###### (7 - 10 hours)

1. Next move onto [multivariable calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/multivariable-calculus). Complete the sections "Thinking about multivariable functions", "Derivatives of multivariable functions", and "Applications of multivariable derivatives". Again, if you have time, feel free to complete the whole course.

2. [Paul's Online Math Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) has a complete coverage of all Calculus 1, 2, and 3 topics.

#### Reference Options
- [UCBerkeley Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw6pHhjhKmk) by Professor Edward Frenkel
- Michael Corral's textbook [Vector Calculus](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/calc3book.pdf).
