### <a name="section-a"></a>1. NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. matplotlib

matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.

matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc, with just a few lines of code.

#### matplotlib Tutorials

Get Started - [Nicolas P. Rougier matplotlib tutorial](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/)

*If you enjoy charting, explore [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) and [their official tutorial](http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html). It is an advanced charting library built on top of matplotlib.*

### <a name="section-c"></a>3. pandas

pandas is an open source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

We will use pandas extensively throughout the rest of the Foundations and main curriculum. It's use in data science is comparable to Microsoft Excel in the business world.
