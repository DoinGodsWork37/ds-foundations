# Web Development

You might be wondering why we are learning about building websites and apps? The reason is that you may want to create an interactive app or present your final projects so you can share with anyone that is not a data scientist. A beginner level understanding will enable you to do this.

### <a name="section-a"></a>1. HTML / CSS

HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of contentâ€”using, for example, fonts or colors.

These are the 2 main languages used in building websites.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. A microframework is a term used to refer to minimalistic web application frameworks. It is contrasted with full-stack framework also called enterprise frameworks. Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn, and the community web page for Flask itself.

Note: The code is in Python 2.7, so you will have to update certain syntax to Python 3.5. You can skip the Virtual Environment setup instructions, since that is meant for people developing several Flask apps at a time.

### <a name="section-c"></a>3. Assignments

1. Complete Shay Howe's introductory course and if you find this topic interesting the advanced one as well. If you ever want to present your data science projects as an interactive web application, you now have the foundations of design to make it look presentable.

2. Complete the entire Flask book and all the exercises. If you get stuck, review the companion code on the author's GitHub repository.
