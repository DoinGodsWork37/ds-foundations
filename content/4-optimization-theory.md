### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Introduction

The interplay between optimization and machine learning is one of the most important developments in modern computational science. Optimization formulations and methods are proving to be vital in designing algorithms to extract essential knowledge from huge volumes of data. Machine learning, however, is not simply a consumer of optimization technology but a rapidly evolving field that is itself generating new optimization ideas.

Here is an [introduction to the main concepts](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/optimization_intro.pdf) taken from the book Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven VandenBerghe from Stanford University. ([Full text link](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/), not required to complete for Foundations program)
