## <a name="section-b"></a>2. Submitting Work

Once you have completed all the content in Week 0, you should understand how to use Git/GitHub. These are the steps you should follow to submit work:

1. Fork the repository onto your account
2. Pull the repository down to your local computer
3. Complete assignments
3. Commit changes to the local repository and push them to your online GitHub repository
4. No need to submit a Pull Request, a TA will check your work routinely and give feedback when necessary

## <a name="section-c"></a>3. Questions

If anything is unclear or you get stuck, [please reach out immediately](<mailto:hello@k2datascience.com>). The program was created by data scientists and machine learning engineers. We have a biased view of which concepts should be learned in which order. We have tried to put ourselves in your shoes, but there is always room for improvement!
