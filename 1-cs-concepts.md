## Regular Expression

In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular expression (sometimes called a rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching, i.e. "find and replace"-like operations. The concept arose in the 1950s, when the American mathematician Stephen Kleene formalized the description of a regular language, and came into common use with the Unix text processing utilities ed, an editor, and grep, a filter.

Regexes are so useful in computing that the various systems to specify regexes have evolved to provide both a basic and extended standard for the grammar and syntax; modern regexes heavily augment the standard. Regex processors are found in several search engines, search and replace dialogs of several word processors and text editors, and in the command lines of text processing utilities, such as sed and AWK.

Here is a [basic tutorial for regex](https://regexone.com/).

## Shell and Bash Scripting

Since you have already completed the command line tutorial, here is a tutorial that shows what you can do with [bash scripting](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/03/introduction-to-bash-scripting/). For a more advanced guide, [go here](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/). Advanced bash scripting is out of the scope of the course, but it can help save time once you deploy machine learning models into production.

## Memoization

The term "memoization" was introduced by Donald Michie in the year 1968. It's based on the Latin word memorandum, meaning "to be remembered". It's not a misspelling of the word memorization, though in a way it has something in common. Memoisation is a technique used in computing to speed up programs. This is accomplished by memorizing the calculation results of processed input such as the results of function calls. If the same input or a function call with the same parameters is used, the previously stored results can be used again and unnecessary calculation are avoided. In many cases a simple array is used for storing the results, but lots of other structures can be used as well, such as associative arrays, called hashes in Perl or dictionaries in Python.

Memoization can be explicitly programmed by the programmer, but some programming languages like Python provide mechanisms to automatically memoize functions.

Here is a [brief overview of memoization](https://technotroph.wordpress.com/2012/04/05/memoize-it-the-python-way/).

## Big-O Notation, Algorithms and Data Structures

The three topics mentioned in the heading are the fundamental building blocks of modern computer science theory.

Here is a [simple explanation](https://justin.abrah.ms/computer-science/big-o-notation-explained.html) of how Big-O notation.

Here is how you [calculate it](https://justin.abrah.ms/computer-science/how-to-calculate-big-o.html) with a few examples to go along.

Here is a great [cheat sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) for reference.

[Sorting and Searching Algorithms](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Sorting_and_Searching_Algorithms.html) will come up in interviews and understanding how these work help when you design software. Follow along with the material and complete the exercises.

For a review of classicial data structures, please see [this website](https://python.swaroopch.com/data_structures.html). These concepts are integral to computer science theory. Build out each data structure in Python from scratch. Feel free to use Wikipedia, Google or other reference websites for help.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Unlike other older languages, Python comes with many data structures built-in. You have most likely come across many of them, but here is a [page that has a complete overview](https://pythonschool.net/category/data-structures-algorithms.html).
