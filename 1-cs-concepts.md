### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Bits, bytes and binary numbers

A bit (short for binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. Although computers usually provide instructions that can test and manipulate bits, they generally are designed to store data and execute instructions in bit multiples called bytes. In most computer systems, there are eight bits in a byte. The value of a bit is usually stored as either above or below a designated level of electrical charge in a single capacitor within a memory device.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. Regular Expression

In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular expression (sometimes called a rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching, i.e. "find and replace"-like operations. The concept arose in the 1950s, when the American mathematician Stephen Kleene formalized the description of a regular language, and came into common use with the Unix text processing utilities ed, an editor, and grep, a filter.

Regexes are so useful in computing that the various systems to specify regexes have evolved to provide both a basic and extended standard for the grammar and syntax; modern regexes heavily augment the standard. Regex processors are found in several search engines, search and replace dialogs of several word processors and text editors, and in the command lines of text processing utilities, such as sed and AWK.

Here is a [basic tutorial for regex](https://regexone.com/).

### <a name="section-c"></a>3. Big O Notation

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

Here is a [simple explanation](https://justin.abrah.ms/computer-science/big-o-notation-explained.html) of Big-O notation.

Here is how you [calculate it](https://justin.abrah.ms/computer-science/how-to-calculate-big-o.html) with a few examples to go along.

Here is a [reference sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).

### <a name="section-d"></a>4. Algorithms and Data Structures

[Sorting and Searching Algorithms](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Sorting_and_Searching_Algorithms.html) will come up in interviews and understanding how these work help when you design software. Follow along with the material and complete the exercises.

For a review of classicial data structures, please see chapters 17 through 20 of [the original version of the Think Python book]( http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/html/) (this code is in Python 2). These concepts are integral to computer science theory.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Unlike other older languages, Python comes with many data structures built-in. You have most likely come across many of them, but here is a [page that has a complete overview](https://python.swaroopch.com/data_structures.html).
