## Calculus

Multivariate differentiation is the cornerstone for many optimization functions.

If you have not reviewed Calculus in awhile, review the [Khan Academy section](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home). You only need to cover "Limits and continuity", "Taking derivatives" and "Derivative applications". Integration is necessary for our curriculum.

Next move onto [multidimensional calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/multivariable-calculus).  Complete the sections "Thinking about multivariable functions", "Derivatives of multivariable functions", and "Applications of multivariable derivatives".
