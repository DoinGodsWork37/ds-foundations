### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Full Review

Multivariate differentiation is the cornerstone for many optimization functions. *If you have a preferred resource or textbook, feel free to use that.*

If you have not reviewed Calculus in awhile, review the [Khan Academy section](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home). You only need to cover "Limits and continuity", "Taking derivatives" and "Derivative applications". Integration is not necessary for our curriculum, but feel free to review it if you have time!

Next move onto [multivariable calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home/multivariable-calculus).  Complete the sections "Thinking about multivariable functions", "Derivatives of multivariable functions", and "Applications of multivariable derivatives". Again, if you have time, feel free to complete the whole course.

If you prefer a classical academic approach, feel free to watch this [UCBerkeley Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw6pHhjhKmk) by Professor Edward Frenkel.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. Refresher

If you prefer an abridged text summary of the same topics, here is [a set of notes](resources/mvc.pdf) by Barbara Niethammer and Andrew Dancer at Oxford University. There are not many visualizations and the last section dives into manifolds. Manifolds are out of the scope of our curriculum, but take a stab at learning more about it. Serious data scientists are able to alter off-the-shelf algorithms with advanced mathematics and create truly amazing machine learning systems.

### <a name="section-c"></a>3. Summary

If you have taken Multivariable Calculus in an academic setting before, here is a [1 page summary version](resources/calculus-1.pdf).
