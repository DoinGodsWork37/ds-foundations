### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Python

Anaconda is the leading data science platform for Python. The open source version of Anaconda is a high performance distribution of Python and includes over 100 of the most popular Python packages for data science.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. Command Line

If you are serious about a career that involves programming, you need to start getting comfortable using the Command Line Interface. It was the main style of inteface for computers before Mice and graphical operating systems were invented. If you are old enough to have used MS-DOS, you know what I'm talking about!

### <a name="section-c"></a>3. Text Editors (Terminal and Graphical)

You will probably spend most of your time with access to a graphical interface, where you have more choices in editors and integrated development environments.

We recommend the Atom Text Editor. [Learn Enough Text Editor](https://www.learnenough.com/text-editor-tutorial)


Sometimes you will need to use a non-graphical text editor. This means an editor that will run entirely inside a terminal window, without spawning a new window, entirely without mouse input.

We recommend VIM. [VIM Guide](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-vim-an-interactive-guide)

### <a name="section-d"></a>4. Git Version Control

Git is a version control system; think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code. You see a path of these snapshots, in which order they where created. You can make branches to experiment and come back to snapshots you took.

GitHub, is a web app on which you can publish your Git repositories and collaborate with other people.

### <a name="section-e"></a>5. Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

You will be using the Jupyter Notebook almost every day of the bootcamp.

[Quick Start Guide](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Jupyter will already be installed with Anaconda, so read chapter 1 and 3.
