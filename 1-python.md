### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Think Python

[Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters.

The book starts with the introductory concepts and progressing all the way towards advanced contructs. It is available as a [downloadable PDF](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) or you can browse the [online HTML version](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html). Several example programs and solutions to some exercises are located in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython2/tree/master/code).
