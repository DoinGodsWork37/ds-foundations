[Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html) is an introduction to Probability and Statistics for Python programmers.

Think Stats emphasizes simple techniques you can use to explore real data sets and answer interesting questions. The book presents a case study using data from the National Institutes of Health. Readers are encouraged to work on a project with real datasets.

If you have basic skills in Python, you can use them to learn concepts in probability and statistics. Think Stats is based on a Python library for probability distributions (PMFs and CDFs). Many of the exercises use short programs to run experiments and help readers develop understanding. It is available as a [downloadable PDF](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf) or you can browse the [online HTML version](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/index.html). Several example programs and solutions to some exercises are located in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2).
