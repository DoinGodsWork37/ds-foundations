## Optimization Theory

The interplay between optimization and machine learning is one of the most important developments in modern computational science. Optimization formulations and methods are proving to be vital in designing algorithms to extract essential knowledge from huge volumes of data. Machine learning, however, is not simply a consumer of optimization technology but a rapidly evolving field that is itself generating new optimization ideas.

Here is an [introduction to the main concepts](resources/optimization_intro.pdf) taken from the book Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd and Lieven VandenBerghe from Stanford University. ([Full Text](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/))

For a more intermediate coverage of topics necessary for machine learning algorithms, please see [this presentation](resources/optimization_short.pdf).

For a complete coverage of all convext optimization concepts, here is a [great resource](optimization_long.pdf). The level of mathematics covered here is beyond the scope of the bootcamp. If you have a strong background in mathematics, please review this text or the complete book by Stephen Boyd referenced above as it will definitely help down the road when you start exploring advanced machine learning algorithms.
